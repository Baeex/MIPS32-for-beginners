# MIPS32-for-beginners
This repository contains a small collection of MIPS32 assembly programs written to run on **QtSpim**.  
The programs cover basic input/output, arithmetic, conditionals, loops, and arrays.

They are intended as simple, standalone programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts of MIPS assembly programming.

## 🧰 Requirements
To run these programs you need:

- **QtSpim** (MIPS32 simulator)

## ▶️ How to run
1. Open **QtSpim**
2. Go to **File → Reinitialize and Load File**
3. Select one of the `.s` files
4. Run the program

Each file is an independent program and should be loaded separately.

## 📂 Programs included
- **hello_world.s** – Prints a simple "Hello World" message.  
- **counter_between_limits.s** – Counts between two given limits.  
- **fahrenheit_to_celsius.s** – Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.  
- **fibonacci_no_loop.s** – Calculates Fibonacci numbers without using a loop.  
- **lower_to_upper_conditional.s** – Converts lowercase letters to uppercase using conditional logic.  
- **quadratic_equation.s** – Solves a quadratic equation.  
- **sum_two_values.s** – Reads two numbers and prints their sum.  
- **sum_fives_in_array.s** – Sums all values equal to 5 in an array.  
- **sum_array_values.s** – Sums all values in an array.  
- **sum_array_with_conditions.s** – Sums array values that meet specific conditions. 

## ⚠️ Notes
- Each program is **standalone** and should be loaded individually in QtSpim.
- These programs are meant to be simple and easy to read.
- No external libraries or tools are required besides QtSpim.
